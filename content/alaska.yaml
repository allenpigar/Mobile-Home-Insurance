    body: "<h5 id=\"_notekincurrentlydoesntoffermobilehomeinsuranceinalaskabutwerecomingsoonstaytuned_\"><em>Note: Kin currently doesn't offer mobile home insurance in Alaska, but we're coming soon! Stay tuned.</em></h5>\n<p>The harsh landscape and sparse population drives up the cost of living in Alaska, and that makes the mobile homes an attractive option for those looking to minimize their expenses. But manufactured homes are still a major investment, so owners need the right <a href=\"/mobile-home-insurance/\">mobile home insurance</a> to protect it.</p>\n<p>We understand how insuring a mobile home is different than insuring a traditional home and have designed a process for getting coverage that <a href=\"/reviews/\">our policyholders love</a>. Find out how our Alaska manufactured home insurance protects your greatest asset.</p>\n<h2 id=\"alaskamobilehomefacts\">Alaska Mobile Home Facts</h2>\n<p>Alaska boasts nearly <a href=\"https://www.infoplease.com/us/census/alaska/housing-statistics\">18,000 mobile homes</a>, accounting for about seven percent of its total housing units. Most of these mobile home owners live in one of the 36 mobile home parks in the state. Cities often have regulations prohibiting mobile homes in certain zones. Anchorage, for one, only allows mobile homes in licensed parks and low-density residential neighborhoods if they were built before 1976. The only exception is when a mobile home is temporary lodging while permanent housing is being built. Then it can go in other residential districts.</p>\n<p>The reason for these rather complicated regulations is that mobile homes built prior to 1976 don’t meet certain building code standards. Modern manufactured homes, however, meet the demands of Alaska’s harsh winters.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatisalaskamobilehomeinsurance\">What Is Alaska Mobile Home Insurance?</h2>\n<p>Alaska mobile home insurance is a policy that covers the structure of your mobile home and all of the things inside it. Having this insurance reduces your out-of-pocket costs if your property is damaged or destroyed in a covered event, such as a fire or windstorm. Mobile home insurance also includes coverage for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Other structures, like a shed or fence.</li>\n<li>Additional living expenses if you have to relocate.</li>\n<li>Lawsuits where someone claims you caused their financial loss.</li>\n<li>Immediate medical care if a guest is injured on your property.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Most mobile home parks require you to have mobile home insurance. Even if you aren’t required to get it, it makes sense to get some to protect your biggest investment.</p>\n<p>At Kin, we offer a mobile home policy that goes further than other insurers. Our Alaska mobile home policy boasts <a href=\"/glossary/replacement-cost/\">replacement cost coverage</a>, getting you a claim payment that’s roughly equal to buying the items at today’s prices, up to your policy limits. Many policies out there only cover you for the depreciated value of your home and belongings.</p>\n<h2 id=\"alaskamobilehomeinsurancecosts\">Alaska Mobile Home Insurance Costs</h2>\n<p>Alaska manufactured home insurance is tailored to your property and needs, so costs vary widely based on:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your zip code.</li>\n<li>The age and condition of your mobile home.</li>\n<li>Your mobile home’s square footage.</li>\n<li>The condition of your plumbing and electrical.</li>\n<li>Safety features.</li>\n<li>The value of your belongings.</li>\n<li>How much liability insurance you choose.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Your premium can also be impacted if you choose additional coverage or opt for a lower <a href=\"/glossary/standard-deductible/\">deductible</a>. Applying is the best way to get an accurate idea of what your policy might cost. call or quote. We’ll punch in all the data and give you a free, no obligation quote.</p>\n<h2 id=\"alaskamobilehomeinsurancediscounts\">Alaska Mobile Home Insurance Discounts</h2>\n<p>Discounts help homeowners save based on positive habits that reduce risk or costs to the insurer. Kin has seven potential discounts for mobile home owners:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You reside in a mobile park.</li>\n<li>You have smart home protective devices.</li>\n<li>You are 50 years or older.</li>\n<li>You’ve had no lapse in coverage for the past three years.</li>\n<li>You have a clean claims history.</li>\n<li>Your mobile home is your primary residence.</li>\n<li>You elect for an electronic policy.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"howisalaskamobilehomeinsurancedifferentfromhomeownersinsurance\">How Is Alaska Mobile Home Insurance Different from Homeowners Insurance?</h2>\n<p>In Alaska, mobile home insurance is similar to <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">traditional homeowners insurance</a> in a couple of ways. Both provide coverage for your home and other structures on your property on an open-perils basis, which means they cover losses except those specifically spelled out in the policy. Some of the more common losses come from fire, windstorm, burst pipes, and theft.</p>\n<p>We also offer both <a href=\"/glossary/ho7-policy/\">HO7</a>, the mobile home policy, and <a href=\"/glossary/ho3-policy/\">HO3</a>, standard home insurance, as replacement cost coverage. This is key to making you whole in a total loss. However, HO7 only provides this coverage for your home and other structures. Homeowners insurance, or HO3, extends it to these as well as your personal belongings.</p>\n<p>Another notable difference between mobile home insurance and traditional homeowners insurance is in the way insurance carriers rate the policies. Mobile homes in Alaska are more likely to suffer damage because they aren’t built directly on a foundation, so insurance companies charge higher premiums for them.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mobilehomevsmanufacturedhomevsmodularhome\">Mobile Home vs. Manufactured Home vs. Modular Home</h2>\n<p>You might be wondering what the difference is between a mobile home and a manufactured home. The term is often used for what seems like the same type of structure, a home built in a factory on chassis and moved to where the owner wants to live.</p>\n<p>That definition is correct for both a mobile and manufactured home with one critical difference: the date of manufacture. As of June 15, 1976, the Department of Housing and Urban Development required mobile homes to meet certain safety and building standards, and then later mandated that homes built after this date be called manufactured homes. Prefabricated homes built before 1976 are technically mobile homes.</p>\n<p>And just to further complicate things, you also have modular homes. These are homes built in segments in a factory, shipped in sections, and assembled on the owner’s property. Segments can be combined in unique and variable ways. Unlike mobile and manufactured homes, modular home owners must buy traditional homeowners insurance to properly protect their property.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howtogetanalaskamanufacturedhomeinsurancequote\">How to Get an Alaska Manufactured Home Insurance Quote</h2>\n<p>We’re here to help you get a mobile home insurance quote quickly and easily.
