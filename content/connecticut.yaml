      body: "<p>Mobile homes in Connecticut often resemble retirement communities. Most are governed by mobile home associations to maintain a high standard of living for everyone in the park. These communities often require <a href=\"/mobile-home-insurance/\">mobile home insurance</a> to make sure everyone is properly protected, too.</p>\n<h6 id=\"_notekincurrentlydoesntoffermobilehomeinsuranceinconnecticutbutwerecomingsoonstaytuned_\"><strong><em>Note: Kin currently doesn't offer mobile home insurance in Connecticut, but we're coming soon! Stay tuned.</em></strong></h6>\n<h2 id=\"connecticutmobilehomefacts\">Connecticut Mobile Home Facts</h2>\n<p>Here are some key statistics about the Nutmeg State’s mobile home population:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Connecticut has approximately 11,000 mobile homes.</li>\n<li>Most mobile homes reside in the state’s 201 mobile home parks.</li>\n<li>The average cost of a 1,500 square foot double-wide home with a garage is $130,000.</li>\n<li>Mobile homes make up less than one percent of Connecticut’s housing market.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"whatisconnecticutmobilehomeinsurance\">What Is Connecticut Mobile Home Insurance?</h2>\n<p>Connecticut mobile home insurance includes coverage for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The dwelling:</strong> This protects the structure of your home and what makes it tick, like its plumbing, electrical, HVAC, etc.</li>\n<li><strong>Other structures:</strong> This coverage pays for damage to structures on your property, such as sheds and garages.</li>\n<li><strong>Additional living expenses:</strong> Your insurance company gives you money to stay somewhere if your mobile home is unlivable during a claim.</li>\n<li><strong>Personal liability:</strong> If someone claims you’re responsible for their property damage or injuries, this coverage pays your legal costs.</li>\n<li><strong>Medical payments:</strong> Insurers reduce the chance of a claim by covering minor medical costs if someone gets hurt while visiting you.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When shopping for a policy, look for options that offer <a href=\"/glossary/replacement-cost/\">replacement cost coverage</a> for the home. This can help you replace your home when you have a total loss instead of paying out only the home's depreciated value.</p>\n<p>Most mobile home associations require residents to have insurance. This protects the mobile home park and its residents in liability claims. Someone who isn’t required to get mobile home insurance may want to consider getting a policy anyway. Your mobile home is a major investment, and a loss without insurance would mean you’d have to pay to replace your property out of pocket.</p>\n<h2 id=\"thecostofmobilehomeinsuranceinconnecticut\">The Cost of Mobile Home Insurance in Connecticut</h2>\n<p>Connecticut tends to be reasonable when it comes to the costs of mobile home insurance. Many mobile home owners can get policies for under $1,000 a year, but your premium depends on a lot of factors, such as your home's location, age, condition, and features.</p>\n<p>A mobile home with safety features will usually get a better rate than one that doesn’t. The same is true for age: older mobile homes are considered riskier so insurance costs tend to be more.</p>\n<p>Policy terms also impact your premium. For example, opting for higher limits or a lower deductible typically drives up your rates.</p>\n<p>The best (and easiest) way to know what a policy might cost you is to get a quote.</p>\n<h2 id=\"discountsonmobilehomeinsuranceinconnecticut\">Discounts onMobile Home Insurance in Connecticut</h2>\n<p>Your mobile home insurance could be eligible for a discount if:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You live in a mobile park.</li>\n<li>You have smart home protective devices.</li>\n<li>You are 50 years or older.</li>\n<li>You’ve had no lapse in coverage in the past three years.</li>\n<li>You have a clean claims history.</li>\n<li>Your mobile home is your primary residence.</li>\n<li>You elect for an electronic policy.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"howisconnecticutmobilehomeinsurancedifferentfromhomeownersinsurance\">How Is Connecticut Mobile Home Insurance Different from Homeowners Insurance?</h2>\n<p>Mobile home insurance and traditional homeowners insurance are similar in the protection they provide. Both cover the structure on an open-perils basis, which means your dwelling is covered for any event except those specifically listed in the policy as exclusions. Additionally, both policies can insure your property for its replacement cost rather than its <a href=\"/glossary/actual-cash-value/\">actual cash value</a>.</p>\n<p>The big difference is in the underlying policy forms. Mobile home owners insure their property using an <a href=\"/glossary/ho7-policy/\">HO7 policy</a> while traditional home owners usually need an <a href=\"/glossary/ho3-policy/\">HO3 policy</a>. They need their own forms because they are built differently. Traditional homes adhere to local building codes whereas manufactured homes are built to meet federal standards.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mobilehomevsmanufacturedhomevsmodularhome\">Mobile Home vs. Manufactured Home vs. Modular Home</h2>\n<p>There is a difference between mobile and manufactured and modular homes, and the type of home you have determines the type of insurance you need. Both mobile and <a href=\"/blog/what-is-a-mobile-home/\">manufactured homes</a> are built on their chassises and transported to the location where the owner plans to live. The only difference between these is that a manufactured home indicates a mobile home built after June 15, 1976.</p>\n<p>This is the date the US Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) instituted new safety standards for mobile homes. Later, HUD decided to describe homes as manufactured if they were built after 1976 and conform to HUD’s regulations.</p>\n<p>Modular homes are built in factories, but they’re made up of sections. The homeowner chooses modules which are shipped to their property. Once there, the modular home is assembled on a foundation. Modular homes generally don’t have to follow HUD regulations, but they are built to state and city codes and are insured through traditional <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners insurance</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howtogetaconnecticutmanufacturedhomeinsurancequote\">How to Get a Connecticut Manufactured Home Insurance Quote</h2>\n<p>To get the most accurate quote, have the following information ready:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your mobile home <a href=\"/blog/mobile-home-vin/\">vehicle identification number</a> found on the data plate inside your home or on its steel frame.</li>\n<li>An estimated value of your personal belongings.</li>\n<li>Proof of prior insurance and security upgrades to get the relevant discounts.</li>\n</ul>"
