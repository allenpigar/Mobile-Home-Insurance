    body: "<p>Whether they live in Rayne, the Frog Capital of the World, or along the historic streetcar tracks in New Orleans, Louisianans take great pride in their state. One thing they might get particular satisfaction from is the state’s cost of living. It’s five percent less than the national average.</p>\n<p>But even with the low cost of living, Louisianans can have a hard time finding insurance if they live in a mobile home. Affordable <a href=\"/mobile-home-insurance/\">mobile home insurance</a> is already difficult to come by, but when you add in the weather risks in Louisiana the cost can be astronomical.</p>\n<p>We’re here to change that. Just like we did for our <a href=\"/mobile-home-insurance/florida/\">Florida mobile home policyholders</a>, we’re bringing a tech-based approach to insurance that can help Louisiana mobile and manufactured homeowners save on the coverage they need.</p>\n<h2 id=\"louisianamobilehomefacts\">Louisiana Mobile Home Facts</h2>\n<p>Louisiana has <a href=\"https://www.infoplease.com/us/census/louisiana/housing-statistics\">240,944 mobile homes</a> mobile homes spread out across 605 mobile home parks.This accounts for 13 percent of all housing units in the Pelican State, which is more than twice that of the national average. Moreover, mobile homes are the second-most popular structure for single family residences.</p>\n<p>These stats show that mobile homes are an integral part of life in the state. But so are hurricanes and the damage they bring, which makes Louisiana mobile homes insurance is a necessity.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatislouisianamobilehomeinsurance\">What Is Louisiana Mobile Home Insurance?</h2>\n<p>Mobile home insurance pays for damages to your mobile home and belongings in the event of a catastrophic loss. Policies are similar to homeowners insurance in that they cover:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The structure of the home.</li>\n<li>Your personal property inside the home.</li>\n<li>Detached structures, like a fence or garage.</li>\n<li>Additional living expenses if damages require you to temporarily move.</li>\n<li>Your personal liability if someone sues you for property damage or bodily injury.</li>\n<li>Immediate medical payments when someone’s injured on your property.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The coverage we offer in Louisiana further protects you because it’s <a href=\"/glossary/replacement-cost/\">replacement cost coverage</a>. This means your policy pays to repair or replace your mobile home (or belongings) based on today’s market value for the same or similar items. Other policies may insure for the <a href=\"/glossary/actual-cash-value/\">actual cash value</a> of these items, which only pays their depreciated value.</p>\n<p>Most mobile home parks require you to have mobile home insurance –– though you should consider it even if you are on private land. Without it, you’re on the hook for the repairs, medical bills, and lawsuits that can follow accidents.</p>\n<h2 id=\"louisianamobilehomeinsurancecosts\">Louisiana Mobile Home Insurance Costs</h2>\n<p>Average statewide mobile home insurance premiums in Louisiana are $2,355, according to our data, but a lot of factors play into your specific cost. Insurers look at a variety of factors when determining manufactured home insurance costs in Louisiana, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Where you live.</li>\n<li>What type of mobile home you have.</li>\n<li>Your home's age and condition.</li>\n<li>The age and condition of your internal systems such as electrical and plumbing.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Homeowners can save money if they install safety devices such as tie downs and other storm mitigation equipment that reduces the chance of damage from a storm. On top of that, mobile home owners can customize policies by increasing their deductible to bring premium costs down.</p>\n<h2 id=\"louisianamobilehomeinsurancediscounts\">Louisiana Mobile Home Insurance Discounts</h2>\n<p>You might be eligible for premium discounts if:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your mobile home is in a mobile home park.</li>\n<li>You have smart home protective devices (e.g., a security alarm or water mitigation system).</li>\n<li>You are 50 years of age or older.</li>\n<li>You’ve had continuous coverage on your mobile home.</li>\n<li>You haven’t filed a claim for at least three years.</li>\n<li>You are a new mobile home buyer.</li>\n<li>You opt for an electronic policy.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"howislouisianamobilehomeinsurancedifferentfromhomeownersinsurance\">How Is Louisiana Mobile Home Insurance Different from Homeowners Insurance?</h2>\n<p>Louisiana mobile home insurance, sometimes called an <a href=\"/glossary/ho7-policy/\">HO7 policy</a>, and traditional homeowners insurance, also known as <a href=\"/glossary/ho3-policy/\">HO3</a>, have several similarities. Both protect your home and belongings as well as provide coverage for your liability. At Kin, both our HO7 and HO3 policies also offer replacement cost coverage to make sure you are made whole after a claim.</p>\n<p>But you also should understand that a mobile home is considered a higher-risk category than a traditional home. There are a few reasons why. First, mobile homes made prior to 1976 may not comply with federal safety standards. Additionally, not having a foundation increases your chances of suffering major damage. This is why it can be more expensive to insure a mobile home than a traditional house.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mobilehomevsmanufacturedhomevsmodularhome\">Mobile Home vs. Manufactured Home vs. Modular Home</h2>\n<p>A <a href=\"/blog/what-is-a-mobile-home/\">mobile home and a manufactured home</a> are both prefabricated structures that can be moved to different locations, but they have one key difference: safety standards. Prior to 1976, anything that fit that description was called a mobile home. After that, the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) imposed safety regulations. To make the distinction clear, HUD later mandated that prefabricated homes be called manufactured homes.</p>\n<p>Either way, mobile home insurance is the appropriate policy.</p>\n<p>You don’t want to confuse mobile and manufactured homes with modular homes. These are also prefabricated, but they’re made of different sections. Each section is moved to the building site separately to be assembled. Modular homes don’t have to follow HUD’s regulations. Instead, they’re built to state and local building codes, and owners need traditional home insurance policies to protect them.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howtogetalouisianamanufacturedhomeinsurancequote\">How to Get a Louisiana Manufactured Home Insurance Quote</h2>\n<p>Don’t waste time guessing what manufactured home insurance in Louisiana might cost you.
