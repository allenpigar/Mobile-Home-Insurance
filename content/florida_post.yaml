It’s also home to 104 mobile home parks, offering residents a lifestyle that combines work and play.</p>\n<p>But being so close to either coast can be risky. In fact, Clearwater is a prime target for storms like Irma and Michael, and hurricane winds can be especially hard on <a href=\"/home-insurance/mobile-home-insurance/\">mobile homes</a>.</p>\n<p>While it’s been historically hard to find <a href=\"/mobile-home-insurance/florida/\">affordable mobile home insurance in Florida</a>, we’re changing that. On average, our Clearwater mobile home policies cost $862 a year.</p>\n<h2 id=\"clearwatermobilehomeinsurancecosts\">Clearwater Mobile Home Insurance Costs</h2>\n<p>Florida mobile home insurance is expensive because mobile homes are particularly vulnerable to winds and floods. Additionally, mobile home insurance carriers in Florida often don’t rate homes dynamically based on location, which drives prices up.</p>\n<p>There’s a better way to do things. We price your coverage based on your mobile home’s actual risk rather than on a statewide level. The result is a much more affordable policy – for Clearwater, that’s about $862 a year on average, nearly $250 less than the average for the whole state.</p>\n<p>Curious to see how we stack up against the competition? Take a look at the statewide averages below.</p>\n<h4 id=\"averagefloridamobilehomeinsurancepremiumsbycarrier\">Average Florida Mobile Home Insurance Premiums by Carrier</h4>\n<p>| Kin | American Integrity | American Traditions |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| $1,110 | $1,379 | $1,258 |</p>\n<p>Average premiums give you a sense of what your costs might look like, but the only way to know for sure is to get a quote. Your premium may vary depending on the size, construction, and age of your mobile home; your claims history; your location; and more.</p>\n<h3 id=\"averagecostbycounties\">Average Cost by Counties</h3>\n<p>Your premium depends on several factors, such as your mobile home’s age and size, its construction, your claims history, and more. But of all these factors, your location plays a key role.</p>\n<p>Think about it this way: a home right along the coast is more likely to experience hurricane damage than a home 20 miles further inland.</p>\n<p>To give you an idea of how location can impact premiums, take a look at our average prices by the county below.</p>\n<h4 id=\"averagekinmobilehomeinsurancepremiumsbycounty\">Average Kin Mobile Home Insurance Premiums by County</h4>\n<p>| County | Average Yearly Premium |\n| --- | --- |\n| Pinellas | $862 |\n| Dade | $2,422 |\n| Manatee | $1,100 |\n| Sarasota | $1,202 |</p>\n<p>These are some ways mobile homeowners anywhere can reduce insurance costs:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use of anchor ties that meet city codes.</li>\n<li>Have a fully enclosed foundation or skirt.</li>\n<li>Install handrails where there are three or more steps.</li>\n<li>Occupy your property (don’t rent it out).</li>\n<li>Properly maintain the property.</li>\n<li>Keep a clean claims history if possible.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We’ll walk you through some additional discount opportunities when you <a href=\"https://welcome.kin.com/start\">apply for a quote.</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"whatclearwatermobilehomeinsurancecovers\">What Clearwater Mobile Home Insurance Covers</h2>\n<p>You probably know most mobile home insurance policies only offer actual cash value coverage for the dwelling. That’s not the case with Kin. We only offer replacement cost coverage for your mobile home so you can buy a new home when yours is claimed by a total loss.</p>\n<p>A reliable mobile home policy should include the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-a/\"><strong>Dwelling coverage</strong></a> to repair or replace your mobile home after a covered claim.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-b/\"><strong>Other structures coverage</strong></a> to repair or replace structures like a carport or patio.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-c/\"><strong>Personal property coverage</strong></a> to help you replace belongings like clothing, furniture, electronics, and more.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-d/\"><strong>Loss of use coverage</strong></a> to help you cover temporary relocation costs when a covered claim makes your home uninhabitable.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-e/\"><strong>Personal liability coverage</strong></a> to pay legal fees if you’re sued over someone’s injuries or property damage.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-f/\"><strong>Medical payments coverage</strong></a> to pay for medical bills when someone is hurt on your property.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We can easily customize your policy with additional <a href=\"/glossary/insurance-endorsement/\">endorsements</a>.</p>\n<p>Make sure you are prepared for risks, big and small, when living in a Clearwater mobile home. It’s estimated that nearly 27 people out of 1,000 will experience a property theft. This doesn’t include losses because of a fire or storm.</p>\n<p>Your mobile home insurance policy needs to protect against everyday risks such as fire and theft as well as bigger catastrophes such as hurricanes and floods.</p>\n<p>Without <a href=\"/home-insurance/hurricane-insurance/\">hurricane coverage</a>, mobile home owners can have uncovered claims resulting in serious financial loss. Hurricane insurance is designed to pay for damages resulting from storm winds and a <a href=\"/home-insurance/flood-insurance/\">flood insurance endorsement</a> pays for damages resulting from storm surge.</p>\n<p>Your Kin mobile home policy automatically covers you for hurricanes. Ask your Kin representative about adding flood insurance for just a little extra.</p>\n<h3 id=\"tipsforloweringclearwatermobilehomeinsurancecosts\">Tips for Lowering Clearwater Mobile Home Insurance Costs</h3>\n<p>Looking for ways to save even more on your mobile home insurance? Clearwater mobile homeowners are often eligible for these <a href=\"/faq/home-insurance-discounts/\">discounts</a>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Security device discount.</li>\n<li>In-park discount.</li>\n<li>Mature mobile homeowner discount.</li>\n<li>Primary residence discount.</li>\n<li>Claims-free discount.</li>\n<li>Electronic policy discount.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Preventing and keeping claims down is the number one way to avoid premium increases. When possible, pay for small losses (such as someone stealing a bike) without filing a claim. This keeps you claim free and helps save money over the long haul.</p>\n<p>If you have any questions about getting insured in Clearwater, call us at <a href=\"tel:855-717-0022\">855-717-0022</a>.</p>"

When they do find a company that will underwrite the policy, they often pay for something that doesn’t cover what it would cost to actually replace their mobile home.</p>\n<p>Kin created a mobile home policy that is competitively priced and covers your mobile home’s replacement cost. The average mobile home premium in Daytona Beach is $953 a year for Kin customers, and the Kin statewide average is $1,110 a year for mobile home insurance.</p>\n<p>Compare that to the average premiums of other mobile home insurance providers below.</p>\n<h4 id=\"averagefloridamobilehomeinsurancepremiumsbycarrier\">Average Florida Mobile Home Insurance Premiums by Carrier</h4>\n<p>| Kin | American Integrity | American Traditions |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| $1,110 | $1,379 | $1,258 |</p>\n<h3 id=\"averagecostbycounties\">Average Cost by Counties</h3>\n<p>On top of working hard to be competitive across all state pricing, Kin assesses risk based on an area’s actual exposure.

Even though Daytona Beach rarely experiences a direct hit from a hurricane despite its 26 miles of coastline, this protection is essential for any Florida homeowner.</p>\n<p>Daytona Beach’s proximity to the Atlantic coast, as well as the Halifax Rivers, also makes it prone to storm surge and flooding.

Though Fort Myers residents are resilient and quick to rebuild after storms, the importance of home insurance as a tool to restore normalcy can’t be overstated.</p>\n<p>That’s why we’re proud to offer affordable <a href=\"/mobile-home-insurance\">mobile home coverage</a>. Our policyholders in Fort Myers pay an average of only $1,296 a year.</p>\n<h2 id=\"fortmyersmobilehomeinsurancecosts\">Fort Myers Mobile Home Insurance Costs</h2>\n<p>Fort Myers (located in Lee County) faces a higher hurricane risk than some other Florida counties, which impacts its average premiums. The age, construction, and size of your mobile home also impacts your premium, as does your claims history.</p>\n<p>The average Kin policyholder in Fort Myers pays $1,296 a year for insurance, just above the our state average of $1,110 a year.

As a general rule, if the loss is lower than your deductible, that’s a repair that should probably be handled outside of insurance.</p>\n<p>You can also lower your premium by taking on a higher deductible. But as we mentioned above, your insurance should only help pay for losses greater than your deductible. So a word of caution: don’t take on a deductible so high that it prevents you from reasonably using your coverage when you need it.</p>\n<p>Have any questions about getting insured in Fort Myers?

It also helps pay to repair your home with new, similar materials after a covered claim.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-b/\"><strong>Other structures coverage</strong></a>: This helps to replace or rebuild other structures on your property, such as a shed or a carport.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-c/\"><strong>Personal property coverage</strong></a>: This pays to repair or replace your damaged or lost property, such as clothing, appliances, and more.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-d/\"><strong>Loss of use coverage</strong></a>: When a covered claim forces you to temporarily relocate, this can help pay for additional living expenses, such as hotel stays, dining out, and more.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-e/\"><strong>Personal liability coverage</strong></a>: If someone sues you over property damage or bodily injuries that happen on your property, this can help cover your legal expenses.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-f/\"><strong>Medical payments coverage</strong></a>: When a visitor has a small injury on your property, this can help cover their ambulance ride and office visit.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can also customize your policy with <a href=\"/glossary/insurance-endorsement/\">endorsements</a>.</p>\n<p>For example, your policy can already cover a lot of perils – or events that cause damage and trigger your policy’s coverage. Theft, fire, and vandalism are all examples of covered perils.</p>\n<p>Our policies also include <a href=\"/home-insurance/hurricane-insurance/\">hurricane coverage</a>. As you might’ve seen with Hurricane Michael in 2018, Tallahassee is not immune to direct hurricane hits.</p>\n<p>But flood insurance does not come standard with any policy. It must be added on. That’s why we offer an easy <a href=\"/flood-insurance\">flood insurance endorsement</a>. It gives you more coverage than National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) policies and offers essential flood protection.</p>\n<h2 id=\"tipsforloweringtallahasseemobilehomeinsurancecosts\">Tips for Lowering Tallahassee Mobile Home Insurance Costs</h2>\n<p>To help Tallahassee mobile homeowners save as much as possible, we offer several <a href=\"/faq/home-insurance-discounts/\">discounts</a>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Security device discount.</li>\n<li>In-park discount.</li>\n<li>Mature mobile homeowner discount.</li>\n<li>Primary residence discount.</li>\n<li>Claims-free discount.</li>\n<li>Electronic policy discount.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While you can make changes to take advantage of some of these (install security devices or opt for an electronic policy), you can’t quickly change your claims history or where your home is. So another option is to increase your deductible to lower your premium. Just make sure you don’t take on a deductible so high that it prohibits you from filing claims when you need to.</p>\n<p>Not sure what deductible makes sense for you?
