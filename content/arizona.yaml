    body: "<p>Arizona is known for its hot climate where summer activities typically mean cooling off with enjoying iced tea inside an air-conditioned home. Unfortunately, all of that heat can wreak havoc on your home, causing materials to warp and crack. That and the increased water usage may cause problems with your pipes.</p>\n<p>The possibility for property damage makes getting quality <a href=\"/mobile-home-insurance/\">mobile home insurance</a> essential for protecting the manufactured home and your belongings.</p>\n<p><em>Note: Kin currently doesn't offer mobile home insurance in Arizona, but we're coming soon! Stay tuned.</em></p>\n<h2 id=\"arizonamobilehomefacts\">Arizona Mobile Home Facts</h2>\n<p>Mobile homes account for nearly <a href=\"https://www.infoplease.com/us/census/arizona/housing-statistics\">14 percent of Arizona’s total housing units</a>, which translates to 302,575 mobile home units in the Grand Canyon State. The <a href=\"https://housing.az.gov/manufactured-housing\">Manufactured Housing Division</a> (MHD) of Arizona’s Department of Housing maintains safety standards for these homes that are consistent with the standards put out by the US Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).</p>\n<p>In addition to regulation from HUD and MHD, every mobile home park has its own set of rules. Most require that you obtain a valid mobile home insurance policy, so check with park management for details.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatisarizonamobilehomeinsurance\">What Is Arizona Mobile Home Insurance?</h2>\n<p>Arizona mobile home insurance is a policy designed to protect you from financial loss if your mobile home suffers damage from a variety of events, such as a fire, burst pipe, or windstorm. It also adds liability protection coverage to pay for claims where a third-party states you’re responsible for their property damage or bodily injury.</p>\n<p>Our Arizona manufactured home insurance covers:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your dwelling.</li>\n<li>Your personal belongings.</li>\n<li>Other structures on your property, like a garage.</li>\n<li>Additional living expenses if you have to temporarily move after a catastrophe.</li>\n<li>Your personal liability.</li>\n<li>Medical payments for people injured on your property.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Additionally, our policies are written as replacement cost coverage. This means that in a claim we pay for repairs or a replacement based on what it costs for new items today. Most other carriers’ policies insure mobile homes based on their actual cash value so they only pay for the depreciated value of your property.</p>\n<h2 id=\"arizonamobilehomeinsurancecosts\">Arizona Mobile Home Insurance Costs</h2>\n<p>Arizona manufactured home insurance typically costs anywhere from $300 to $1,000 per year. The reasons rates vary so much is because insurance carriers look at several factors when calculating premium. The most important of these is the zip code for your mobile home. From there, however, carriers consider:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The size of your home.</li>\n<li>The year it was built.</li>\n<li>Any upgrades you’ve made.</li>\n<li>The value of your personal property.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Because there are so many variables that go into mobile home premiums, we recommend getting a free quote. It’s really the only way to find out exactly how much Arizona manufactured home insurance will cost you.</p>\n<h2 id=\"arizonamobilehomeinsurancediscounts\">Arizona Mobile Home Insurance Discounts</h2>\n<p>Most discounts for Arizona mobile home insurance help owners save money when they have safer living habits. For example, you might be eligible for reduced premium if:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You reside in a mobile park.</li>\n<li>You have smart home protective devices.</li>\n<li>You are 50 years or older.</li>\n<li>You’ve had no lapse in coverage for the past three years.</li>\n<li>You have a clean claims history.</li>\n<li>Your mobile home is your primary residence.</li>\n<li>You elect for an electronic policy.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"howisarizonamobilehomeinsurancedifferentfromhomeownersinsurance\">How Is Arizona Mobile Home Insurance Different from Homeowners Insurance?</h2>\n<p>Mobile home insurance, sometimes called an <a href=\"/glossary/ho7-policy/\">HO7 policy</a>, and traditional <a href=\"/home-insurance\">homeowners insurance</a> are pretty similar. Both cover your structure and personal belongings as well as your personal liability. Moreover, both policies are open-perils coverage, which means they cover any loss unless it’s caused by something specifically listed as excluded from the policy.</p>\n<p>What is different between the policies is how the policies are underwritten. Because Arizona mobile homes are not built to the same standards as traditionally-built homes, they are viewed as higher risks. This sometimes translates to higher-than-expected premiums.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mobilehomevsmanufacturedhomevsmodularhome\">Mobile Home vs. Manufactured Home vs. Modular Home</h2>\n<p>There’s a lot of confusion when talking about mobile, manufactured, and modular homes. Often these terms are all used interchangeably, but there are differences between them.</p>\n<p>Most people use the term “mobile home” to describe a factory-built dwelling assembled on a chassis that is transported to the residential location, either a mobile home park or private property. Technically, however, this definition only applies if the home was built before 1976. That’s when HUD created safety standards for mobile homes. A few years later, HUD decided prefabricated homes built after 1976 should be called manufactured homes.</p>\n<p>Next came modular homes. These are also factory-built dwellings that get moved to residential sites. However, modular homes are built and moved in sections. They also don’t necessarily meet HUD’s safety standards; although they do comply with state and local building codes.</p>\n<p>Where mobile and manufactured homes both need mobile home insurance, modular homes are protected by standard homeowners insurance.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howtogetanarizonamanufacturedhomeinsurancequote\">How to Get an Arizona Manufactured Home Insurance Quote</h2>\n<p>To get a quote, be prepared to share your residential address, the mobile home vehicle identification number (VIN), and an estimate of the value of personal property. <a href=\"/blog/mobile-home-vin/\">VIN numbers</a> can be found on the data plate of your mobile home (on the interior) or stamped on the steel frame.</p>"
